# someMATLABapps
a number of MATLAB apps that I've written over the years and found useful for some of my research

#1 DigitizeFigure
This tool allows you to do exactly what its name implies. Sometimes you have a scatter plot in a paper but the paper doesn't provide the underlying data table. That makes it difficult to analyze these data sets i.e., integrate them in your own work or just plot them in combination with your own data. So, this little app allows you to a) reference an image (e.g., a png or jpg) and then b) to digitize it. Subsets of the data can be assigned via different feature ID numbers. Digitized data are stored and then can be used in further analysis.
